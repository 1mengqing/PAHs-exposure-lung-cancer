# PAHs-exposure-lung-cancer
Heterogeneity of immune cells in PAHs exposure and lung cancer progression: a single-cell sequencing study 



## Background


In recent years, the detrimental effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on human health have garnered increasing attention, with a particular focus on their association with lung cancer. PAHs are ubiquitous environmental pollutants generated during incomplete combustion of organic materials, presenting a serious risk to individuals exposed to contaminated air, water, and food sources.

The correlation between PAH exposure and the development of lung cancer has been a subject of intensive research, emphasizing the urgent need to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying this association. Lung cancer, a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, poses a formidable public health challenge. Identifying early biomarkers for lung cancer is crucial for timely intervention and improved prognosis.


## Summary


This study aims to investigate the impact of PAH exposure on the peripheral blood immune cells and molecular expression profiles in humans. By discerning key alterations in immune cell function and molecular signatures induced by PAH exposure, our research seeks to pinpoint critical biomolecules that could serve as potential early diagnostic markers for lung cancer. Through a comprehensive analysis of these changes, we aspire to contribute valuable insights to the field of cancer research and advance our understanding of the intricate relationship between PAH exposure and the early stages of lung carcinogenesis.

This comprehensive methodology aimed to uncover alterations in gene expression at the single-cell level, providing valuable insights into the impact of PAH exposure on the human peripheral blood immune cell transcriptome. The bioinformatics analyses aimed to identify potential biomarkers and unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between PAH exposure and early stages of lung carcinogenesis.
